	<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
	<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

	<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

	<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
		<li>Magic City, ID</li>
		<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
		<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
		<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
		<li>Why, AZ</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
	<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: </p>
	<blockquote>
		"Passing cars, <br>
		When you can't see, <br>
		May get you, <br>
		A glimpse, Of eternity."<br>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars. :)</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Burma Shave Signs</dt>

	<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
		Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>cell phone, </li>
		<li>iPod, </li>
		<li>digital camera, </li>
		<li>and a protein bar. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Just the essentials. As <b>Lao Tzu</b> would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one <strike>step</strike> Segway.</q></p>

	<q>There's going to be an evil henchman meetup next month at my underground lair in &#208;&epsilon;&tau;&#114;&ouml;&igrave;&tau;.</q>
