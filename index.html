					<h2>About</h2>
						<p>On this website, you'll find me fight to the death, going through all the chapters from the <em>HeadFirst HTML and CSS</em> textbook and watching my amazing progress throughout this book. You'll be watching firsthand, as I tackle up to 700+
							pages scavenging for knowledge about HTML and CSS while avoiding death from improper usage of them. The available chapters increase in size over time, directing surviving readers into broader areas of
							expertise. The last developer standing wins the round. I hope you find this informational and let it be an inspiration to all web designers or aspiring to-be out there.</p>

						<p>The site was first released for Windows, Macs, Linux and just about any OS available with a browser. It has received extremely positive reviews from all the critics during both the early access period and on official release, consumers filed
							in lines waiting to view it. The website has also received several awards for its wonderful presentation and clever use of basic text and pictures.</p>
